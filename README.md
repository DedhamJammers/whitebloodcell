Our Game Jam 2018 game: Play as a white blood cell, fighting to keep the body alive


How To Play 

Cell Frontier is a game where you travel through the human body defeating viruses before they break in to your fellow cells and kill them. You use the **W, A, S,** and **D** keys to move around, and the **mouse** (or touchpad) to steer more precisely.You shoot tube things by pressing the **space key**. If you touch a `virus` (`viruses` are small purple balls) it is destroyed.
